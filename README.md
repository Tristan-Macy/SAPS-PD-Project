# SAPS-PD-Project
Academic Project in Biostatistics Course analyzing SAPS-PD scores. (Done in SAS)

SAPS/SAPS-PD Background:
	For any disease or condition, developing appropriate biomarkers is an essential step in the process of creating a treatment or cure.  Developing biomarkers for neurological diseases is particularly difficult.  The scale for the assessment of positive symptoms (SAPS) is a rating scale developed to measure positive symptoms in schizophrenia.  The scale is comprised of four domains: hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior, and positive formal thought disorder.  Since its creation, the SAPS rating scale has been modified for use in other neurological conditions.  One recent adaptation applies to psychosis in Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) patients and is called SAPS-PD.
Dataset
	The SAPS-PD is comprised of components from both the hallucinations and the delusions domains from the original SAPS.  The hallucinations domain contains 5 questions and the delusions domain contains 4 questions.  Each question is judged on a Likert scale from 0 (None or No Symptom; Good) to 5 (Severe Symptom; Bad).  The final score is the mean of the 9 Likert scale questions.
In a preliminary study of the natural history of PD-related psychosis in a group of PD patients an investigator enrolled patients from two hospitals and followed them for six months.  Each patient was to fill out the SAPS-PD at baseline, after three months, and again after six months. Data is split between hospital center A and hospital center B.
